This weather application was my first project using TypeScript and integrating APIs, built to showcase both functional design and clean user experience. It fetches real-time weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API and presents it through a simple, responsive UI. Focusing on designing intuitive interactions, I aimed to make the interface accessible and user-friendly across devices. This project reflects my growing skills in front-end development and my attention to detail in crafting engaging, user-centered digital experiences.
